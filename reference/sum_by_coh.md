# Present value for each uptake cohort and calculation time

Calculates the sum of the Present Value by uptake cohort (`j`) and time
at which the calculation is performed (`tzero` input to
[`dynpv()`](https://MSDLLCpapers.github.io/dynamicpv/reference/dynpv.md))

## Usage

``` r
sum_by_coh(df)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  Tibble of class "dynpv" created by
  [`dynpv()`](https://MSDLLCpapers.github.io/dynamicpv/reference/dynpv.md)
  or
  [`futurepv()`](https://MSDLLCpapers.github.io/dynamicpv/reference/futurepv.md)

## Value

A number or tibble

## Details

The [Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value) of a
cashflow \\p_k\\ for the \\u_j\\ patients who began treatment at time
\\j\\ and who are in their \\k\\th timestep of treatment is as follows
\$\$PV(j,k,l) = u_j \cdot p_k \cdot R\_{j+k+l-1} \cdot (1+i)^{2-j-k}\$\$
where \\i\\ is the risk-free discount rate per timestep, \\p_k\\ is the
cashflow amount in today’s money, and \\p_k \cdot R\_{j+k+l-1}\\ is the
nominal amount of the cashflow at the time it is incurred, allowing for
an offset of \\l = tzero\\.

This method returns \\\sum\_{k=1}^{T-j+1} PV(j,k,l)\\ for each value of
\\j\\ and \\l\\, where \\T\\ is the time horizon of the calculation.
