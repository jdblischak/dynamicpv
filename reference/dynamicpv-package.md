# dynamicpv: Evaluates Present Values and Health Economic Models with Dynamic Pricing and Uptake

The goal of 'dynamicpv' is to provide a simple way to calculate (net)
present values and outputs from health economic models (especially
cost-effectiveness and budget impact) in discrete time that reflect
dynamic pricing and dynamic uptake. Dynamic pricing is also known as
life cycle pricing; dynamic uptake is also known as multiple or stacked
cohorts, or dynamic disease prevalence. Shafrin (2024)
[doi:10.1515/fhep-2024-0014](https://doi.org/10.1515/fhep-2024-0014)
provides an explanation of dynamic value elements, in the context of
Generalized Cost Effectiveness Analysis, and Puls (2024)
[doi:10.1016/j.jval.2024.03.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.03.006)
reviews challenges of incorporating such dynamic value elements. This
package aims to reduce those challenges.
