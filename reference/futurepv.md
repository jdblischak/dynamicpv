# Calculate present value for a payoff in a single cohort with dynamic pricing across multiple timepoints

Present value of a series of payoffs for a single given cohort, entering
at given future time, allowing for dynamic pricing. This function is a
wrapper for
[`dynpv()`](https://MSDLLCpapers.github.io/dynamicpv/reference/dynpv.md)
restricted to evaluation of a single cohort.

## Usage

``` r
futurepv(tzero = 0, payoffs, prices, discrate)
```

## Arguments

- tzero:

  Time at the date of calculation, to be used in lookup in prices vector

- payoffs:

  Vector of payoffs of interest (numeric vector)

- prices:

  Vector of price indices through the time horizon of interest

- discrate:

  Discount rate per timestep, corresponding to price index

## Value

A tibble of class "dynpv" with the following columns:

- `j`: Time at which patients began treatment

- `k`: Time since patients began treatment

- `l`: Time offset for the price index (from `tzero`)

- `t`: Equals \\j+k-1\\

- `uj`: Uptake of patients beginning treatment at time \\j\\ (from
  `uptakes`)

- `pk`: Cashflow amount in today's money in respect of patients at time
  \\k\\ since starting treatment (from `payoffs`)

- `R`: Index of prices over time \\l+t\\ (from `prices`)

- `v`: Discounting factors, \\(1+i)^{1-t}\\, where `i` is the discount
  rate per timestep

- `pv`: Present value, \\PV(j,k,l)\\
